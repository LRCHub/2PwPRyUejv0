Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.

You ever love someone so much you thought your little heart was gonna
Break in two?
I didn't think so.
You ever tried with all your heart and soul to get you lover back to
You?

I wanna hope so.
You ever pray with all your heart and soul just to watch her walk away?

Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, feel like crying, feel like crying.
You ever toss and turn your llying awake and thinking about the one you
Love?
I don't think so.

You ever close your eyes you making believe your holding the one your
Dreaming of?

Well if you say so.
I hurts so bad when you finally know just how low, low, low, low, low,

She'll go.
Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
Baby did a bad bad thing, feel like crying, feel like crying.
Ohh. Feel like crying, feel like crying.
Ohh, feel like crying, feel like crying.
(Guitar Solo)
Baby did a bad bad thing, baby did a bad bad thing.
