Bad Bad Bad Bad Girls

They're comin' down the street,
The kinda girls you've just got to meet
My mother told me all about you
Look wild, look mean, look bad and a little obscene
I'm sure they could show you a thing or two
When the night starts comin' around, And girls start putting it down
Bad Bad Girls
Give me some more, give some more than I was looking for
I'll go crazy and do anything you can do
Bad Bad Bad Bad Girls
Gimme a shot, gimme a shot of anything you got
They're waiting to put the finger on you.
They're bad, I said bad

They're hot, they're bad
Got the moves for making you mad
They're ready to do the number on you
Temperature's off the clock, These girls ain't gonna stop
They're waiting to put the fire on you

When the night starts comin around, And girls start putting it down
Bad Bad Girls
Give me some more, give some more than I was looking for
I'll go crazy and do anything you can do
Bad Bad Bad Bad Girls
Gimme a shot, gimme a shot of anything you got
They're waiting to put the fire on you.
They're bad, gonna eat you alive better run, better hide, So look out
When the night starts comin' around, And girls start putting it down
Bad Bad Girls
Give me some more, give some more than I was looking for
I'll go crazy and do anything you can do
